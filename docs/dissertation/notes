Two events:
 - begin
 - until

Both types of conditionals. Presumed that previous steps of the recipe ensure that the
conditions to start a recipe are met e.g. preheat to 200 or leave to marinate for 2 hours.

Conditionals allow us to mix until "mixed". The concrete implementation can then be used
to link this to a signal from a camera in the case of a robot (or some other decision
logic).

For time keeping it is probably best to have a global clock so that timings for each
station can still be compared.
